I built this website for [Machine Television](https://machinetelevision.com). Using a straightforward Next.js application and deploying it on Vercel, I’ve managed to achieve satisfying speeds despite the occasional lengthy initial load time due to the numerous images. To enhance first display times, I render background images as they load individually.

We’re planning to add an e-commerce store and a blog soon. For the blog, I’ll be using Markdown and Obsidian as a CMS, integrated with GitHub workflows/actions.

Overall, I’m really proud of this website. I love Jorge’s brand and vision, and I look forward to continuing to support and develop his site.
