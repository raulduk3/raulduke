Hey everybody!  
  
Since graduating last May, I've developed and launched [greasyvocab.com](http://greasyvocab.com/) ([greasy.com](http://greasy.com/) was taken). It's a full stack web application to help those preparing for the GRE enhance their study experience with personalized flashcard sentences.  
  
I built GREasy using Next.js and deployed on Vercel. The sentences are generated using GPT4o. GREasy offers a simple and responsive user experience on any mobile device. I hope to expand on the available features to include mnemonics, editable cards, and individual progress tracking.  
GREasy emails two-hundred printable flashcards drawn from vocabulary that's commonly tested on the GRE and used by leading study platforms. GREasy is completely free to use, lightweight, and designed to be user-friendly. Additionally, I've included an optional donation features, with half of all proceeds going towards international humanitarian aid.  
  
I am currently maintaining and servicing GREasy independently ðŸš€
