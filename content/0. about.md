Hey! My name is Rick and I am an avid programmer and filmmaker with a lifelong passion for computer science and a film education from Kenyon College. My skill set, developed through courses in video post-production, film business, and screenwriting, support both my creative abilities and my capacity for collaboration.

I’m really into VFX and want to get better with tools like Nuke, Maya, Blender, Cinema 4D, and Python.

In my free time, I like to sing, study mushrooms, go cycling, and practice yoga. Journaling is a big part of my life, and I use Zettelkasten-esque system to keep my thoughts organized.

I’m also in the NYU Tandon Bridge program, working on my master’s in Computer Engineering. My dream is to work in visual effects and mix my programming skills with filmmaking.
